## Create a Source
In the [source-template](https://github.com/soku-cn/source-template), click on the "Use this template" button > "Create a new repository"  
![getting-started1](./getting-started(1).png)

Enter the necessary repository information and click the "Create repository" button to successfully create a brand new Source!

If you later want to distribute this new Source to your users, you'll need to set up Github pages.
Please refer to https://pages.github.com/.

## Fork Source
Unless you're a manager of a large group, creating your own Source may not make much sense.  
If you want to help maintain a community Source or if you've developed a cool new module to share with everyone, you can try forking the Source's repo before requesting permission from the admins.  
Forking means copying an identical repo from the original repo to your account. Any actions you take won't affect the original repo until you submit a pull request (PR) and it's merged into the main branch by the original repo's admins.

Let's take [SokuCN's main Source](https://github.com/soku-cn/main-source) as an example:
Click the "Fork" button in the top left.  
![getting-started3](./getting-started(3).png)
Press the "Create fork" button. 
![getting-started4](./getting-started(4).png) 
Done!  
Now you've successfully forked SokuCN's main Source.

## Source in SokuSourceEditor
Regardless of how you create the Source, you can open it in SokuSourceEditor using the same method.  
Click the green "Code" button.
Copy the URL.  
![getting-started5](./getting-started(5).png)
Open SokuSourceEditor, switch to the Source page, click the + button.  
Paste the URL, click "Add," and wait for a moment. 
![getting-started6](./getting-started(6).png) 
Now you've successfully opened the Source in SokuSourceEditor!

## Set Main Source
If you manage multiple Sources, you can set a main Source.   
Click the three dots next to the Source, choose "Set as primary." 
![getting-started7](./getting-started(7).png)
This sets the module as the main Source.  
  
The modules included in the Source set as the main one will be displayed on the Module page.
Yes, that's it. It's just a convenient feature; there's no difference between operating on the Module page and the Module tab under the Source.
